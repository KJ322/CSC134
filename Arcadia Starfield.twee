:: Astronomer {"position":"875,0","size":"100,100"}
Astronomers can tell where they are with only the stars above and around them. They're pretty handy to know when you need to find your way.

Welcome to Arcadia Starfield.

:: Mechanic {"position":"1000,0","size":"100,100"}
Mechanics can easily take apart and put any machine back together again. They can tell, with a little bit of testing, what materials can be used to fix a problem with machinery.

Xenobiologists are great with plants and animals. They're easily able to identify which plants are edible, and which animals are agressive.

:: check fuel {"position":"400,400","size":"100,100"}
You check the fuel indicator, and find just enough left to propel yourself a little ways from where you are currently drifting helplessly through space.

(if:$techSkills > 6)[|fuelLeft>[You glace over to the scanners and see a stellar nursery nearby. You have enough fuel to get there.]]

[[check scanners]]



:: check scanners {"position":"100,400","size":"100,100"}
You may not have a way to move, but the equipment is still working. The scanner shows a stellar nursery nebula pretty close to your current position.

(if:$starKnowledge > 5)[|stellarNursery>[You know that your best chance of surviving until rescue comes is landing on a planet, and a stellar nursery is a great place to find them]]

[[check fuel]] 


:: start {"position":"225,175","size":"100,100"}
You've been stranded in the Arcadia Starfield for two weeks. The amount of fuel needed for this journey was miscalculated, and you've been stuck here alone since you ran out.
